What to do:

We have like 10 main categories of activities:

- Sports
- Gaming
- Food
- Health and Fitness
- Reading
- Media
- STEM
- Nightlife
- Art
- Sexual Expression

For each category, I want you to create a sentence / prompt that relates to some subtopic.
Add the subtopic underneath the listed broad category:

ex:
- Sports
    - Golf
    - Tennis

for each subtopic write some pretty pretty json sentence 5 times like this:

{
    {
        "text": "What are some golfing events around me?",
        "label": "Golf"
    },
    {
        "text": "Where to golf",
        "label": "Golf"
    }
}
