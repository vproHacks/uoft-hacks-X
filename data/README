Add the subtopic underneath the listed broad category:

ex:

for each subtopic write some pretty pretty json sentence 5 times like this:

{
    {
        "text": "What are some golfing events around me?",
        "label": "Golf"
    },
    {
        "text": "Where to golf",
        "label": "Golf"
    }
}
